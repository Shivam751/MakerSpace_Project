# MakerSpace_Project
Using our hand movements to control the in-game movements rather than keyboard and mouse sounds cool, right?
So, here is my attempt to make this possible for Shooting games.
Using the mediapipe and openCV libraries I wrote python script using which you can control the mouse movements and clicks using your hand gestures.

# Controls
Just open your fist and move your hand around, the cursor will along with your hand. To simulate the left mouse button press, just close your fist.

# Libraries Used
1. openCV
2. mediapipe
3. pyautoGUI
4. win32API
